# S3 general purpose buckets should have Object Lock enabled

## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type aws_s3_bucket and aws_s3_bucket_object_lock_configuration are present in the root module.

This control checks whether an Amazon S3 general purpose bucket has Object Lock enabled. The control fails if Object Lock isn't enabled for the bucket. If you provide a custom value for the mode parameter, the control passes only if S3 Object Lock uses the specified retention mode.

You can use S3 Object Lock to store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. Object Lock can help prevent objects in S3 buckets from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.

This rule is covered by the [s3-bucket-should-have-object-lock-enabled](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-pcidss-policy-set-for-aws-terraform/blob/main/policies/s3/s3-bucket-should-have-object-lock-enabled.sentinel) policy.
